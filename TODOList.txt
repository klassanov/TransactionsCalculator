- Fix issue operation with error only on one file....exit code on operation level, advance input of all operations and updating the results and exit codes upon executing the single operation
  pre-populate the DirectoryProcessingResult
- Reduce code duplication in exchange rate logic

- Handle case of exchange date = null (currently we throw an error which also a valid solution)
- Check if input directory is inserted and if such a directory exists
- Create an operations factory instead of instantiating the operations in the TransactionCalculatorService

- ?Reduce code duplication in tests??
- Take the excel and pdf file paths as input parameters and predispose the presenters to take that paths
- ? Use a second, backup, API for exchange rates client
- ? Currency code as enum
- ? Operation types as enums
- ? Make the IoC configuration in a separate project
- ? Make an extention method for summing currencies??
- ? CreateCalculationOperations() create in a configuration or factory

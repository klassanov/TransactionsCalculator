The software is still a console application, but in future it will become a desktop application.

## Basic functionality
The software takes as an input a directory path and elaborates all the files that have a .txt extention. For each file, number of calculations are performed. The result of the calculations, which are performed over all the files in the specified directory, is presented as a report, which is in turn persisted on the local hard drive. Actually, 2 reports containing the same information are produced: one in PDF format and one in EXCEL format.
